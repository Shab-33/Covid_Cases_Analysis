Used existing covid stats from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, and downloaded two files 'CovidDeaths', and 'CovidVaccinations'.

Normalized the data, then used SQL Statements to showcase different tables and views of the cases for both files.

Then to display the data in a visual aesthetic, I used Tableau to visualise the data from the tables created in SQL
